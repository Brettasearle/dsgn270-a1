## **First impressions**
  When first launching this site you are greeted with a massive hero section featuring pizza, upon second glance it's a low quality stock photo that is blocked by aggressive white lettering. This made myself as the consumer feel very overwhelmed, and it was hard to take in what this website was trying to convey, are you only a pizza place? Do you have the best pizza? I don't know.
   
  Moving to the top of the page everything is in capital letters and low contrast. Which doesn't help anything pop off the page, Combined with boring typography. Also couldn't help but notice we have an option to click pizza menu beside the regular menu at the very top, not sure why that approach was taken. I would have just featured a hero section before the regular menu with the pizza section, but having it as it's own button is a little confusing considering nothing else has this option. A quick scroll through the page and you can see decent use of negative space and grid format for the food and drink menus.

  ## ***Size and Scale***

  This is the webpages most glaring issue, EVERYTHING IS IN CAPITAL LETTERS it makes the text hard to scan because they are conveying the message that everything on the page is important. However it just makes it hard to find the focal point and scan the website easily. The violations of size and scale continue to the menu, where some items start with capital letters and others start lowercase without any clear reason.

  ## ***Perspective***
  The hero section of the home page is done with what seems like an attempt to upset those who initially visit the site. A pixelated over-zoomed picture of pizza with no depth, and all capital bright white text makes it very hard to read. The information is also misaligned, it would have been better to see it follow the F pattern. What's strange is lower down the page the drinks menu has a high quality photo of an Old Fashion sitting on a dark background with bold clean text and nice spacing, displaying all of the drinks in a grid format which makes it easy to scan and select a drink. One small detail that bothers me with the drink menu is its sitting on a picture of an Old Fashion, however, the Old Fashion is not even on the drink menu itself.

  ## ***Typography***

 Colours change on this website constantly, resulting in huge clashes of content. The whole website is confusing as they change the text multiple times, bold things sometimes, and not others. Even the name of the site goes from plain all capital text at the top, to a logo at two other points. This site has no use of repetition what-so-ever, which makes you feel lost in your journey to different parts of the page. 
Font and colour for the text is not only boring, but hard to read, At some points during reading the food menu I had to take breaks due to the background being so bright in contrast to the skinny, pale, small text. I cant imagine how someone with limited vision would navigate this site without issues.

  ## ***Mobile and performance***
 The site is a lot easier to scan on mobile, as it displays it in more of a card format. This helps remedy the issues of getting lost, however, you will still be forced to navigate through information you might not need.
 Total time to interact with the site is 7.1 seconds, which is far to long for this generations attention span. It also doesn't have a scroll track but it doesn't really need one as the page isn't interactive past the top menu.

# What I would change
1. Colours and contrast to make things easier to read.
2. HD pictures taken of food and drinks from the restaurants menu.
3. Have repetition to make the website feel more concise.
4. Help make the important stuff stand out with good typography.
